# 👾 Dev Kumar Nayak's Computer Vision Playground 🖼️🎥

## Welcome to the Matrix! 🌌

Hey there, fellow tech wanderer! You've stumbled upon **Dev Kumar Nayak's** personal vault of mind-bending image processing, video processing, and computer vision projects. Prepare to be amazed as we dive deep into the realms where pixels come alive and videos tell tales! 🚀

### 🚀 About Me

I'm Dev, a tech-savvy Instrumentation and Control major with a minor in the mystical arts of AI/ML. When I'm not decoding the universe, you'll find me lost in the worlds of anime and Marvel. 🌟 Oh, and did I mention? I can speak the language of Python and PLC Ladder like a wizard!

### 📸 My Projects

#### 1. **Image Wizardry 🧙‍♂️**

- **Magical Filters**: Watch ordinary images transform with a flick of code! From sepia tones to surreal dreamscapes, my filters add a touch of magic to every pixel.
- **Face Detection & Recognition**: Ever wanted your computer to recognize you? Well, now it can! Using the power of deep learning, I've taught machines to identify faces in a crowd. Perfect for your next superhero gathering.
- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing and conquering images like a pro. This project breaks down images into meaningful segments, highlighting objects of interest.
- **Style Transfer**: Transform your photos into works of art by blending them with famous paintings. Turn your selfies into Picasso masterpieces!
- **Super Resolution**: Enhance the resolution of images using deep learning models. Perfect for improving old, low-quality photos.
- **Colorization**: Breathe life into black and white images by automatically adding color to them. Ideal for restoring historical photos.

#### 2. **Video Sorcery 🎥✨**

- **Motion Detection**: Bringing static scenes to life! My algorithms detect and highlight movement in videos, making them perfect for security and surveillance.
- **Object Tracking**: Like a hawk, my code keeps an eye on moving objects in real-time, ensuring nothing escapes its gaze. Ideal for sports analysis or tracking your mischievous pet.
- **Action Recognition**: Teaching machines to understand human actions. From waving to jumping, my models can identify and categorize various actions in videos.
- **Video Stabilization**: Smooth out shaky videos for a professional touch. Great for making your handheld footage look cinematic.
- **Video Summarization**: Automatically create short summaries of long videos by identifying key frames and scenes. Perfect for creating trailers or highlights.
- **Pose Estimation**: Analyze human posture and movements in videos. Useful for fitness applications, dance analysis, and more.

#### 3. **Computer Vision Chronicles 🔍📜**

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Guiding robots through complex environments. Using a blend of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and deep learning, I've created autonomous agents that navigate like pros.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Blurring the lines between reality and fiction. My AR projects overlay digital content onto the real world, creating immersive experiences that are straight out of sci-fi.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Turning 2D images into 3D models. This project takes multiple images and reconstructs them into detailed 3D representations, perfect for virtual tours and gaming.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract text from images and documents. Ideal for digitizing books, receipts, and more.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Use computer vision to detect diseases and anomalies in medical images such as X-rays and MRIs. A step towards smarter healthcare.
- **Scene Understanding**: Develop models that can interpret and describe complex scenes in images. Useful for applications like autonomous driving and robot vision.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git
